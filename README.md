# Google Software Product Sprint

This repo contains the code for our "Mock Interview Web Application" project for Google's Software Product Sprint. The purpose of the application is to provide an easy-to-use medium for people to find partners to practice for technical programming interviews. 

By creating an account and filling out a very straightforward form, people can request a mock interview from a peer on the topic, in the spoken language, utilzing the programming language, and at the time-availabilities of their choice. Those requesting mock interviews will also provide a Google Hangouts link along with a paired-programming environment link to share with their mock interviewer.

Those interested in being intervewers for a mock interview can browse a listing of all of the open interview requests, choose one that fits their skill sets, and accept the request.
